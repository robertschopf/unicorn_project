## 🎯 Objective
The aim of the project was to analyse the data provided, gain interesting insights and identify weaknesses and opportunities to increase Unicorn's business growth.
Finally, the results were to be summarised in an interactive dashboard and provide insights into Unicorn's business trend in the period from 2015 to 2018. The dashboard users should then be able to filter the results independently and customise them to their needs (departments).

## 🚀 Approach and Implementation
After analysing the data with SQL, I was able to design an interactive dashboard. The aim was to provide an overview of several key performance indicators (KPIs). The profit results of the individual divisions showed that the furniture division had by far the weakest results.

The company has shown continuous growth in turnover and sales. The peaks tended to be achieved in the months of May, September, November and December.
In the individual product categories, it was evident that technology and office supplies made a positive contribution to the company's results. The furniture category showed a negative trend, even posting a negative result in 2018.
